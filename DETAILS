1. Define System Requirements:
* The system is designed for a university with 1,000 students and 30 classrooms.
* It should allow exam scheduling for multiple courses with different durations.
* Students should be able to indicate any special requirements (e.g., accessibility
needs).
* Seating arrangements must consider student preferences and constraints, such
as social distancing in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Select a Technology Stack:
* Backend: Python with Django framework, PostgreSQL database.
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the user interface.
* Algorithm Development: Custom algorithms for seating optimization.
* Security: TLS encryption, role-based access control, and firewall
configurations.
3. Develop the Backend:
* Create the backend infrastructure with Django and PostgreSQL, defining data
models for students, exams, classrooms, and seating arrangements.
* Implement RESTful APIs to handle data interactions.
4. Create the User Interface:
* Develop a web application with a modern and user-friendly interface using
HTML, CSS, and React.
* Design pages for students to select courses and indicate special requirements,
for teachers to schedule exams, and for administrative staff to oversee the
system.
5. Implement User Authentication:
* Integrate user authentication using Django's built-in authentication system.
Define user roles, such as students, teachers, and administrators, and assign
appropriate permissions.
6. Algorithm Development:
* Design a custom algorithm that takes into account student preferences, room
capacities, and constraints like social distancing.
* Ensure the algorithm optimizes seating arrangements while adhering to
fairness criteria.
7. Database Management:
* Create the database schema in PostgreSQL to store student information, course
schedules, room layouts, and seating assignments.
* Implement data validation and constraints to maintain data integrity.
8. Security Measures:
* Implement TLS encryption to secure data in transit.
* Use role-based access control to manage user access to different parts of the
system.
* Employ firewalls to protect the system from unauthorized access.
9. Testing and Quality Assurance:
* Conduct extensive testing to ensure that the system works as expected.
* Test various scenarios, including multiple exams at the same time, student
conflicts, and special requirements.
* Perform load testing to assess system performance under peak loads.
* Continuously monitor the system for security and performance issues.
